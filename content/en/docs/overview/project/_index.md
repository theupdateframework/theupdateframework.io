description: Learn more about the TUF project
---

The TUF project consists of three components:

- [Specification] – the detailed TUF specification describes how to add TUF
  metadata to a repository and the process to arrange for clients to use that
  metadata to download and verify targets.
- [Standardization process] – major changes to the specification, including new features,
  are made as TUF Augmentation Proposals (TAPs).
- [Reference implementation] – python-tuf provides a reference implementation of
  the TUF specification and is used as a vital part of the TAPs process to prototype
  changes to the specification.

The project is currently managed by a team of collaborators from academia and
industry.

Many people have contributed to the project since its inception, including
academics, professional developers, and contributors from the open-source
community. We especially acknowledge the individuals from the open-source
community who have [contributed] to the TUF project over the years.
