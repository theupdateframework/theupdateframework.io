      description: A Framework for securing software update systems
      whatIsTUF: |
        The Update Framework (TUF) maintains the security of software update
        systems, providing protection even against attackers that compromise the
        repository or signing keys. TUF provides a flexible framework and
        [specification](/specs/)
        that developers can adopt into any software update system.
      projectAndGrants: |
        The TUF project is managed by the [Linux Foundation] under the [Cloud
        Native Computing Foundation][CNCF]. The consensus builder for TUF is [Prof.
        Justin Cappos](https://ssl.engineering.nyu.edu/personalpages/jcappos/)
        of the [Secure Systems Lab](https://ssl.engineering.nyu.edu) at [New
        York University](https://engineering.nyu.edu/). Project
