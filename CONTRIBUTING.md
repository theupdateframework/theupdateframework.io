## Issues & Pull Requests

### Creating an Issue

Before **creating** an Issue i.e for `bug`/`features`/`improvements` please follow these steps:


1.Check Existing Issues: Search to see if the issue already exists.

2.Provide Context: If it doesn't exist, create a new issue with as much detail as possible. Make sure to select the correct issue type (e.g. bug,documentation,feature).

3.Express Interest: If you want to work on the issue after it's been reviewed, mention this in your issue description.

### Working on an Issue

Before starting work on an existing issue, please follow these steps:

1. **Request Assignment**: Comment on the issue asking for it to be assigned to you.
2. **Prepare for Assignment**:
    - Confirm that you have read the `CONTRIBUTING.md`.
    - Ensure you have a functional development environment (you can build and run the project).
    - Describe your intended approach to solving the issue.
    - Include these points in one or more comments.
3. **Start Work**: Begin working on the issue only after it has been assigned to you.
4. **Avoid Conflicts**: Only start working on the issue and open a Pull Request after it has been assigned to you. This prevents confusion, duplicate work, and potential conflicts among contributors.
5. **Reference the Issue**: In your Pull Request, reference the issue (e.g., `This PR fixes #1234`). This ensures the issue is automatically closed when your Pull Request is merged.


> **Notes:**
>
> - **Check the Assignees Box**: Before requesting to be assigned to an issue, check the `Assignees` box at the top of the page to see if it has already been assigned to someone else. If it has a current assignee but appears to be inactive, politely ask them if they are still working on it or if you might collaborate with them.
> - **Requesting Assignment**: Only request to be assigned to an issue if you know how to work on it.
> - **Seek Clarity**: If an issue is unclear, ask questions to get more information before requesting to be assigned. Avoid asking vague questions like "what do I do next?" or "how do I fix this?"
> - **Collaboration**: An issue can be assigned to multiple people if all parties agree to collaborate on it. The pull request can contain commits from different collaborators.
> - **Inactivity**: Any issue with no activity for 2 weeks will be unassigned and re-assigned to someone else.


## Reviewing Pull Requests

We encourage everyone to review pull requests. It's a fantastic way to learn, network, and support each other.

### DOs

- Use inline comments to provide clear explanations for your suggestions.
- Offer inline suggestions to propose changes.
- Exercise patience and empathy when providing feedback on others' work.

### DON'Ts

- Avoid repeating feedback, as it creates unnecessary noise. Check the existing conversation and use GitHub reactions to agree or disagree with a comment.
- Do not approve pull requests without proper review just to improve your GitHub contributors graph.
